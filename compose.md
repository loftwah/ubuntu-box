# Comprehensive and Detailed Explanation of `docker-compose.yml`

This document provides a thorough explanation of a Docker Compose setup that defines a service named **`ubuntu-box`**, which serves as a highly capable development environment. In addition, it covers various associated services and patterns, including how to route requests through an NGINX reverse proxy, how to load test using Locust, and how to integrate advanced networking tools for diagnostics and exploration.

By understanding each component and configuration detail, you can adapt these patterns to build robust, easily maintainable, and production-like development environments.

## Overview of Docker Compose

**Docker Compose** allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications through a single YAML file. You specify your services, networks, volumes, and configurations, and then use simple commands like `docker-compose up` to bring your whole environment to life. This approach streamlines the development process, ensures environments are reproducible, and makes complex stacks easier to run and share.

---

## Primary Service: `ubuntu-box`

The `ubuntu-box` service is designed as a one-stop development container that bundles multiple languages, tools, and utilities. By centralising these tools within a container, you ensure that your local machine’s environment remains clean, and you can guarantee consistency across different team members and CI pipelines.

### Key Features of `ubuntu-box`

- **Multiple Runtimes**: Ruby, Python, Go, Node.js, Rust, and Bun installed in a single image.
- **Tools for Development**: Git, Vim, Nano, build-essential, and more.
- **Network Analysis**: `nmap`, `traceroute`, `tcpdump` available for debugging complex networking issues.
- **AWS CLI and Credentials**: Integrated AWS CLI and read-only access to your local `~/.aws` for seamless cloud interaction.
- **Caching Volumes**: Speeds up repeated builds and installations by leveraging persistent volumes for caches.

### Example `docker-compose.yml` (Focal Service)

```yaml
services:
  ubuntu-box:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro
      - ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro
      - uv_cache:/root/.cache/uv
      - bun_cache:/root/.bun/install/cache
      - go_cache:/go/pkg/mod
    environment:
      - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION:-ap-southeast-2}
      - DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
      - PATH="/app/.venv/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/root/.bun/bin:${PATH}"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000" # Example: Node.js or Bun-based service
      - "8000:8000" # Example: Python-based service (Flask, Django, etc.)
      - "9000:9000" # Example: Go-based service
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    command: /bin/bash
    container_name: ubuntu-box-2025

volumes:
  uv_cache:
  bun_cache:
  go_cache:
```

**What’s Happening Here?**

- **`build.context` & `build.dockerfile`**: The container image is built using the specified Dockerfile in the current directory, ensuring all dependencies and tools are included.
- **Mounted Volumes**:
  - `.:/app`: Shares your current directory with the container, allowing you to edit code locally and run it immediately inside the container.
  - `~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro` and `~/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro`: Provides the container with your AWS and SSH credentials for secure, read-only use. This makes it easy to deploy or interact with remote services without configuring credentials again inside the container.
  - `uv_cache`, `bun_cache`, `go_cache`: Persisted caching directories to speed up re-builds, module downloads, and installation processes.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: Defines your default AWS region.
  - `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`: Avoids interactive prompts during apt-get installations.
  - `PATH` modifications ensure all installed tools (Go, Bun, Python venv) are readily available.
- **Port Mappings**:
  - `3000:3000`, `8000:8000`, `9000:9000` expose services you might run in `ubuntu-box` (Node.js, Python, Go apps respectively) to your host machine.
- **Interactive Settings**:
  - `tty: true` and `stdin_open: true`: Enable an interactive shell experience with `docker exec -it ubuntu-box-2025 bash`.
- **Name Customization**:
  - `container_name: ubuntu-box-2025` sets a fixed container name, making it easier to reference in commands.

## Extended Use Cases

The strength of Docker Compose is that `ubuntu-box` can be just one part of a larger ecosystem. Below are extended examples of how you might integrate additional services and patterns.

---

### Adding an Application Service and NGINX Proxy

In a more complex setup, you might have a dedicated application service (e.g., a Python web service running on port `8000`) and an NGINX service acting as a reverse proxy. The NGINX proxy listens on a publicly exposed port (`8080` on your host), and internally routes traffic to `app:8000`. This decoupling improves security, flexibility, and scalability.

**Traffic Flow**:  
**Browser/Client → Host:8080 → NGINX (proxy:80) → app:8000 (internal docker network)**

This setup mirrors a production environment where NGINX or another load balancer fronts your applications.

#### Example Configuration with `index.html` and Explanation

Here's an improved version that includes the handling of `index.html`, enhanced clarity, and explanation.

---

```yaml
services:
  # Re-using ubuntu-box from above (not repeated here for brevity)

  app:
    image: python:3.12
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    command: ["python3", "-m", "http.server", "8000"]
    expose:
      - "8000"
    # The app is now reachable at http://app:8000 inside the Docker network.

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    depends_on:
      - app
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - ./index.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html:ro
    # NGINX listens on host:8080, and internally routes to app:8000.
```

**Example `nginx.conf`:**

```nginx
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    upstream backend {
        server app:8000; # Points to the 'app' service running Python's HTTP server
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend; # Forward requests to the Python server
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }

        location /index.html {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html; # Serve static index.html from this path
        }
    }
}
```

---

### What’s Happening?

#### Services

1. **App Service (`app`)**:

   - Runs a basic Python HTTP server (`http.server`) on port `8000`.
   - Serves files from the `working_dir` (`/app`), including `index.html` if present.

2. **NGINX Service (`nginx`)**:
   - Acts as a reverse proxy that listens on `host:8080` and forwards requests to the `app` service (`http://app:8000`).
   - Also serves the `index.html` file directly from `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

#### Configuration

1. **Upstream Block**:

   - The `upstream backend` block defines `app:8000` as the target for requests that reach NGINX.

2. **Static File Handling**:

   - The `location /index.html` block allows NGINX to serve `index.html` directly if it's placed in the volume-mounted directory (`/usr/share/nginx/html`).

3. **Reverse Proxy**:
   - The `proxy_pass http://backend` directive routes requests to the Python HTTP server.
   - Headers such as `Host` and `X-Real-IP` are set to preserve client details.

---

### Access Flow

1. If you access `http://localhost:8080/index.html`, NGINX serves the `index.html` file directly.
2. If you access `http://localhost:8080/`, NGINX forwards the request to the Python HTTP server, which serves files from the `app` service.
3. NGINX acts as a mediator, enabling scalability, additional features, or security configurations like TLS.

---

### Why This Setup?

- **Flexibility**: Combines NGINX's strengths (e.g., caching, static file serving, TLS) with Python's simplicity for dynamic file handling.
- **Performance**: Serves static files (like `index.html`) directly via NGINX, reducing the load on the Python server.
- **Extensibility**: Adds features at the proxy layer without modifying the application code.

### Load Testing with Locust

**Locust** is a powerful load testing tool that helps you simulate large numbers of concurrent users, measure performance under load, and identify bottlenecks.

**Scenario**: Suppose you want to test how your `app` service performs under heavy load. You can run Locust in a master-worker configuration, with the master providing a web UI on `http://localhost:8089` and workers generating load against the target host (e.g., `http://nginx:80` internally or `http://localhost:8080` externally).

#### Example Configuration

```yaml
services:
  locust-master:
    image: locustio/locust
    command: ["--master"]
    ports:
      - "8089:8089"
    volumes:
      - ./locustfile.py:/locustfile.py

  locust-worker:
    image: locustio/locust
    command: ["--worker", "--master-host=locust-master"]
    volumes:
      - ./locustfile.py:/locustfile.py
    depends_on:
      - locust-master
```

**`locustfile.py` Example:**

```python
from locust import HttpUser, task

class MyUser(HttpUser):
    @task
    def hit_root(self):
        self.client.get("/")
```

**How to Use:**

1. Run `docker-compose up` with all services (nginx, app, locust-master, locust-worker).
2. Open `http://localhost:8089` to access Locust’s UI.
3. Set the host under test to `http://nginx:80` (internal) or `http://localhost:8080` (external).
4. Start the test. Locust will generate load against the application via NGINX, simulating a realistic production-like scenario.

**Benefits of This Approach:**

- Quickly test how your application behaves under stress.
- Identify performance bottlenecks.
- Experiment with scaling Locust workers or adjusting NGINX configuration before going to production.

### Network Analysis Tools

Your `ubuntu-box` container or a dedicated `network-tools` container can include `nmap`, `traceroute`, and `tcpdump`. With these, you can debug connectivity issues, trace paths, or capture network traffic for analysis.

**Example `network-tools` Service:**

```yaml
services:
  network-tools:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    # By default, tools like nmap, tcpdump, and traceroute are pre-installed in ubuntu-box.
    # Adjust Dockerfile or image as needed.
```

**Common Commands:**

- `nmap -p 8000 app`: Scan ports on the `app` service.
- `traceroute nginx`: Trace network path to the `nginx` service.
- `tcpdump -i eth0`: Capture packets inside the container's network namespace.

---

### Custom Ports and Additional Services

You can run additional services on custom ports (e.g., `42069`) for testing or demonstration purposes. For example, start a simple HTTP server in `network-tools`:

```yaml
services:
  network-tools:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    command: ["python3", "-m", "http.server", "42069"]
    expose:
      - "42069"
    # Now network-tools is serving HTTP traffic on port 42069 internally.
    # You can curl, nmap, or test this service from ubuntu-box or other containers.
```

**Testing from `ubuntu-box`:**

```bash
docker exec -it ubuntu-box-2025 bash
curl http://network-tools:42069
nmap -p 42069 network-tools
```

## Best Practices for Compose Files

1. **Leverage `.env` Files**: Store environment-specific variables in a `.env` file. This keeps your `docker-compose.yml` cleaner and makes it easy to switch environments (development, staging, production) by changing only one file.
2. **Explicit Networks**:  
   By default, Compose services share a default network. For more complex setups, define named networks and assign services to them. This provides greater control over traffic flow and isolation.

   ```yaml
   networks:
     internal_net:
     external_net:

   services:
     app:
       networks:
         - internal_net

     nginx:
       networks:
         - internal_net
         - external_net
   ```

3. **Health Checks**:  
   Implement health checks to ensure services are ready before others depend on them. For example:

   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000"]
         interval: 10s
         timeout: 5s
         retries: 3
   ```

   NGINX or Locust can wait until `app` is healthy before starting load tests or proxying traffic.

4. **Separation of Concerns**:  
   Keep your Compose files modular. For instance:

   - `docker-compose.yml`: Core services (ubuntu-box, app, nginx).
   - `docker-compose.test.yml`: Testing services (locust, CI tools).
   - `docker-compose.network.yml`: Network analysis and debugging services.

   You can combine them with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up` as needed.

5. **Resource Limits**:  
   Consider setting CPU and memory limits to simulate production constraints and ensure each service behaves well under pressure:

   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       deploy:
         resources:
           limits:
             cpus: "0.5"
             memory: "512M"
   ```

---

## Next Steps and Scaling Up

- **Integration with CI/CD**:  
  Integrate your Docker Compose stack with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI to run tests and build artifacts in a controlled environment. The `ubuntu-box` environment ensures a consistent toolset.
- **Advanced Caching Strategies**:  
  Explore using Docker build cache and multi-stage builds for even faster iteration times. Storing dependencies in volumes as shown is a good start, but layering caches can reduce build times further.
- **Monitoring & Logging**:  
  Consider adding services like `Prometheus` and `Grafana` for metrics, or `Elastic Stack` (ELK) for centralized logging. This helps observe system health under load tests and during development.
- **Security Hardening**:  
  Review default credentials, mount points, and permissions. Use read-only mounts and ensure that sensitive files are not inadvertently exposed.
- **Scaling Out**:  
  Experiment with scaling services:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --scale locust-worker=5
  ```

  This will start five Locust workers to increase load generation capabilities.

## Conclusion

By combining the `ubuntu-box` development environment with proxying through NGINX, load testing via Locust, and network analysis tools, you create a versatile and production-like setup directly on your development machine. Docker Compose’s declarative configuration, reproducibility, and extensibility make it straightforward to evolve this environment to meet growing project needs.

Use these patterns as a foundation and adapt them to fit your own applications, ensuring that your development workflow is efficient, reliable, and closely aligned with real-world scenarios.
