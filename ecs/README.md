# AWS ECS Infrastructure - Practical Learning Path

## Core Competencies

### Foundation Layer

- **Container Fundamentals**

  - Docker multi-stage builds
  - Image optimization
  - ECR management
  - Multi-architecture builds

- **Practical Exercise:**

  ```bash
  # Build and optimize a multi-arch image
  docker buildx create --use
  docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    -t <account_id>.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/app:latest . --push
  ```

- **Key Questions:**
  - How do you optimize container image size?
  - What's your strategy for handling application configuration?
  - How do you manage container logs and metrics?

### Infrastructure Layer

- **Core Infrastructure**

  - VPC design (private subnets, endpoints)
  - Load balancer configuration
  - Security groups and NACLs
  - ECS service discovery

- **Practical Exercise:**

  ```hcl
  # Set up entire networking stack
  # Focus on security group rules that make sense
  # Implement proper VPC endpoints for ECR/SSM
  ```

- **Key Questions:**
  - Why specific security group configurations?
  - How do you handle service-to-service communication?
  - What's your approach to VPC endpoint strategy?

### Security Layer

- **Security Implementation**

  - IAM roles (execution vs task roles)
  - Secrets management strategy
  - SOC 2 requirements
  - SSL/TLS configuration

- **Practical Exercise:**

  ```hcl
  # Implement least-privilege IAM
  # Set up secrets management
  # Configure SSL termination
  ```

- **Key Questions:**
  - What's your secrets rotation strategy?
  - How do you handle SSL certificate renewal?
  - What's your approach to IAM role separation?

### Operations Layer

- **Operational Excellence**

  - ECS Exec implementation
  - CloudWatch monitoring
  - Alert strategy
  - Scaling policies

- **Practical Exercise:**

  ```bash
  # Set up ECS Exec debugging
  aws ecs execute-command --cluster mycluster \
    --task task-id \
    --container app \
    --command "/bin/bash" \
    --interactive
  ```

- **Key Questions:**
  - How do you approach container debugging?
  - What metrics drive your scaling decisions?
  - How do you handle ECS service updates?

### Automation Layer

- **CI/CD Implementation**

  - GitHub Actions setup
  - OIDC authentication
  - Infrastructure as Code
  - Deployment strategies

- **Practical Exercise:**

  ```yaml
  # Implement GitHub Actions workflow
  # Focus on security and reliability
  # Include proper error handling
  ```

- **Key Questions:**
  - How do you manage infrastructure drift?
  - What's your deployment rollback strategy?
  - How do you handle CI/CD secrets?

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High-Availability Service

Build a service that:

- Handles instance failures gracefully
- Maintains performance under load
- Implements proper health checks
- Uses appropriate scaling policies

### Scenario 2: Secure Internal Service

Create a service that:

- Runs in private subnets
- Uses VPC endpoints appropriately
- Implements least privilege
- Manages secrets properly

### Scenario 3: Public-Facing API

Deploy an API that:

- Terminates SSL at ALB
- Implements proper security headers
- Handles rate limiting
- Monitors API metrics

## Advanced Challenges

1. **Zero-Downtime Deployment**

   - Blue/green deployment
   - Canary releases
   - Session handling
   - Database migrations

2. **Cross-Account Deployment**

   - IAM roles and trust relationships
   - Resource sharing
   - Security boundaries
   - Monitoring strategy

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Right-sizing tasks
   - Auto-scaling optimization
   - Resource utilization
   - Cost allocation tags

## Reference Architecture

```hcl
# Core infrastructure patterns
# Security group configurations
# IAM role structures
# Monitoring setup
```

## Best Practices

1. Security First

   - Automated alerting
   - Clear debugging procedures
   - Documentation as code

3. Reliability

   - Multi-AZ deployment
   - Proper health checks
   - Automated recovery
   - Backup strategies

4. Performance

   - Container optimization
   - Resource allocation
   - Caching strategies
   - Network optimization

5. Cost Management
   - Right-sizing resources
   - Cleanup procedures
   - Cost monitoring
   - Resource tagging

## Tools and Resources

### Essential Tools

- AWS CLI
- Terraform
- Docker
- Git

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Common operations and troubleshooting
# Real-world examples
# Debugging commands
```

Remember:

- There's no "right" way to learn this
- Focus on understanding rather than memorizing
- Build things that break, then fix them
- Document what you learn
- Share knowledge with others
